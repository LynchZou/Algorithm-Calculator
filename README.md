**--Key Inspect--**
- Use `Functional Programming` to implement
- Use `Makefile` to compile
- Read in `locations.txt` and output to `path.txt` with processing log `log.txt`
- `locations.txt` contains the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE of that location
- Use `Harversine Distance` to calculate distance between two locations
